# Mass Transfer 2 Project: Multistage Extraction Digital Twin

## Overview

A Python-based digital twin for simulating and optimizing multistage liquid-liquid extraction processes. The software numerically solves crosscurrent and countercurrent extraction (including reflux) for arbitrary ternary systems using `scipy.optimize.fsolve`. It generates synthetic datasets, trains a PyTorch neural network surrogate model, and provides rich visualizations — all wrapped in a professional PyQt6 desktop GUI.

**Default System:** Cottonseed oil (A) / Oleic acid (C) / Liquid Propane (B) at 98.5 °C, 625 lb/in² abs.
The software is generalized to accept any user-supplied ternary equilibrium tie-line data.

## Problem Statement

Experimental data collection remains expensive and time-consuming. It is therefore important to create a **digital twin** of process systems found in industries. These digital twins can recreate synthetic data that can be useful for building **surrogate models** using neural networks and other methods.

> **Objective:** Create software (preferably with a graphical user interface) using **Python and Python frameworks** to solve the liquid–liquid extraction / solid–liquid extraction problem through the solution of a system of equations, such that a **large number of stages** can be handled. Generalise the problem-solving approach as much as possible.

---

## Software Requirements

The software must contain the following components, all necessary for parameter optimisation:

### 1. Simulation Framework

A simulation framework for solving **multistage crosscurrent and countercurrent extraction** (either liquid–liquid or solid–liquid systems) and comparison of the two processes.

- Use numerical solvers (e.g., `fsolve` in Python/MATLAB) to solve systems of **non-linear algebraic equations**.
- Provide a **generalised framework** capable of handling a large number of stages.
- For initial testing, use guess values close to graphical solutions to validate results.
- Plot equilibrium data and fit a polynomial through the **LL equilibrium curve** using the right-angle triangle method.

> ⚠️ **No marks will be awarded if graphical methods are used as the primary solution approach.**

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is recommended so that users can:

- Enter various equilibrium datasets.
- Choose between crosscurrent or countercurrent operation.

---

### 2. Heat Map Visualisation

Generate heatmaps displaying:

| Quantity                            | Detail    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| Raffinate / Extract composition     | Per stage |
| Overflow / Underflow composition    | Per stage |
| Flow rates of raffinate and extract | Per stage |
| **Percentage removal of solute**    | Per stage |

The heatmaps must support **any number of stages**.

---

### 3. Response Surface & Optimisation

Generate input–output data to construct a **surrogate model**:

| Parameter                    | Role    |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Number of stages             | Input 1 |
| Solvent amount               | Input 2 |
| Initial feed composition     | Input 3 |
| Percentage removal of solute | Output  |

Use the generated data to create a **response surface** for process optimisation.

---

### 4. Neural Network Model

Fit a neural network model (ANN or RNN) to predict **percentage removal** or **sequential percentage removal** in multi-stage operations:

- Choose the appropriate number of **nodes and layers**.
- Create a **3D surface plot** of percentage removal as a function of any two inputs.
- Create a **contour plot** for the same.
- These plots are necessary for **optimisation of process parameters**.

---

## Group Responsibilities

- Write the **contribution of each member** clearly.
- Each group member must have a **distinct code** to be presented in the PPT.
- All individual codes must be **integrated into a common software**.
- Credit will be given if the algorithm demonstrates **novelty**.

<summary><strong>🔧 Implementation Details</strong></summary>

### Phase 0: Data Understanding & Equilibrium Modeling

**Goal:** Load, validate, and model the ternary equilibrium data so it can be used by all solvers.

**File:** `mass_transfer/core/equilibrium.py`

#### 0.1 Data Format & Conventions

- **Components:** A = Cottonseed Oil (carrier), B = Propane (solvent), C = Oleic Acid (solute)
- **default_tie_lines.json structure:** `phase_1` = raffinate-layer tie-line endpoints, `phase_2` = extract-layer tie-line endpoints. Each row index `i` in phase_1 connects to the same index `i` in phase_2 (they form a tie-line pair).
- **Coordinate system:** Right-angle triangle where x-axis = wt% of A, y-axis = wt% of C, and B = 100 - A - C by closure.

#### 0.2 Solvent-Free Basis Transformation

For numerical solving, convert to solvent-free coordinates:

- **X** = C / (A + C) → solute mass fraction in raffinate (solvent-free)
- **Y** = C / (A + C) → solute mass fraction in extract (solvent-free)
- **N** = B / (A + C) → solvent ratio

#### 0.3 Polynomial Fitting

Fit the following relationships using `numpy.polyfit` (or `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` for non-polynomial models):

1. **Raffinate curve** on the right-angle triangle: C_raff = f(A_raff)
2. **Extract curve** on the right-angle triangle: C_ext = g(A_ext)
3. **Distribution curve:** Y = h(X) — the equilibrium relationship on solvent-free basis
4. **N_raff vs X** and **N_ext vs Y** — solvent ratio curves
5. **Conjugate line** (tie-line correlation): relates a point on the raffinate curve to its conjugate on the extract curve. Fit as X_ext = k(X_raff) or via the conjugate-line slope.

All fits should be stored as callable interpolation functions. Report R² goodness-of-fit.

#### 0.4 Equilibrium Plots (Problem Part i)

Generate the following plots:

- **(a)** N vs X and N vs Y on the same axes
- **(b)** X vs Y (distribution diagram)
- Right-angle triangle diagram with both curves and tie-lines

---

### Phase 1: Crosscurrent Extraction Solver

**Goal:** Solve multistage crosscurrent extraction for any number of stages using `fsolve`.

**File:** `mass_transfer/core/crosscurrent.py`

#### 1.1 Mathematical Formulation

For a crosscurrent cascade with `N_stages` stages:

- **Given:** Feed composition (wt% A, C), feed flow rate F (kg), solvent flow rate S per stage (kg of pure B), number of stages.
- **Each stage `i`:** Fresh solvent S is mixed with raffinate from stage (i-1).

At each stage, the unknowns are the raffinate and extract compositions + flow rates. The equations are:

1. **Overall mass balance:** R\_{i-1} + S = R_i + E_i
2. **Component A balance:** R\_{i-1} · x_A^{i-1} + S · x_A^S = R_i · x_A^i + E_i · x_A^{E,i}
3. **Component C balance:** R\_{i-1} · x_C^{i-1} + S · x_C^S = R_i · x_C^i + E_i · x_C^{E,i}
4. **Equilibrium:** The raffinate composition (x_A^i, x_C^i) lies on the raffinate curve, and the extract composition (x_A^{E,i}, x_C^{E,i}) lies on the extract curve, connected by a tie-line.
5. **Closure:** x_A + x_C + x_B = 1 for each phase.

This gives a system of nonlinear equations for all stages simultaneously, solved with `fsolve`.

#### 1.2 Solver Implementation

- Function `solve_crosscurrent(feed_comp, feed_flow, solvent_flow_per_stage, n_stages, eq_model)` → returns per-stage compositions, flow rates, and % removal.
- Use the equilibrium model from Phase 0 to enforce tie-line constraints.
- Initial guesses: linear interpolation between feed and pure solvent.

#### 1.3 Validation (Problem Part ii)

Solve the specific problem: 100 kg feed with 25% oleic acid, 2 stages, 1000 kg propane per stage. Report:

- Compositions and weights of mixed extracts and final raffinate
- Solvent-free product compositions and weights

---

### Phase 2: Countercurrent Extraction Solver (with Reflux)

**Goal:** Solve countercurrent extraction including extract reflux for arbitrary stages.

**File:** `mass_transfer/core/countercurrent.py`

#### 2.1 Simple Countercurrent (No Reflux) — Foundation

For N stages in countercurrent arrangement:

- Feed enters at one end, solvent at the other.
- Raffinate flows left-to-right, extract flows right-to-left.
- At each stage: mass balance + equilibrium.

**Equations per stage i (i = 1, ..., N):**

1. R*i + E*{i-1} = R\_{i-1} + E_i (where E_0 = entering solvent, R_0 = feed)
2. Component balances for A and C
3. Equilibrium tie-line relationship at each stage

The system of 4N+ unknowns is solved simultaneously with `fsolve`.

#### 2.2 Countercurrent with Extract Reflux — Full Implementation

This is the Ponchon-Savarit analog for liquid-liquid extraction. Key concepts:

- **Extract product end:** The extract E1 from stage 1 is sent to a separator. Solvent is removed to give extract product PE'. A portion R0 is refluxed back as external extract reflux.
- **Raffinate product end:** Raffinate RNp leaves the last stage.
- **Feed stage:** Feed F enters at an intermediate stage, splitting the cascade into enriching and stripping sections.

**Key parameters to compute:**

- **Minimum stages** (total reflux): Stage-stepping at total reflux using equilibrium curve and operating line coincidence.
- **Minimum reflux ratio:** Found when an operating line passes through a pinch point (intersection of operating line with tie-line through feed or tangent to equilibrium curve).
- **Actual design** for a given reflux ratio (e.g., 4.5): Determine number of theoretical stages and feed stage location.

**Difference point (Δ) method — numerical implementation:**

- Enriching section operating point Δ_E and stripping section operating point Δ_S are computed from mass balances.
- Stage-by-stage calculation: from one end, alternate between equilibrium (tie-line) and operating line (passing through Δ) to step off stages.
- Feed stage is where the operating point switches from Δ_E to Δ_S.

All stepping is done numerically (no graphical construction): equilibrium lookups use the fitted polynomial, operating line intersections use root-finding.

#### 2.3 Solver Functions

```
solve_countercurrent_simple(feed_comp, feed_flow, solvent_flow, n_stages, eq_model)
find_min_stages(feed_comp, raffinate_spec, extract_spec, eq_model)
find_min_reflux_ratio(feed_comp, raffinate_spec, extract_spec, eq_model)
solve_countercurrent_reflux(feed_comp, feed_flow, reflux_ratio, raffinate_spec, extract_spec, eq_model)
```

Each returns: number of stages, feed stage location, all stream compositions, flow rates (E1, BE, E', R0, RNp, PE', S).

#### 2.4 Validation (Problem Part iii)

Solve: 1000 kg/h feed, 25% oleic acid → products at 2% and 90% acid (solvent-free).

- (a) Minimum theoretical stages
- (b) Minimum external extract-reflux ratio
- (c) For reflux ratio = 4.5: stages, feed stage, stream quantities
- (d) Maximum purity of oleic acid from equilibrium data (plait point analysis)

---

### Phase 3: Visualization Module

**Goal:** Generate all required plots with publication-quality aesthetics.

**File:** `mass_transfer/viz/ternary_plots.py`, `mass_transfer/viz/heatmaps.py`, `mass_transfer/viz/surfaces.py`

#### 3.1 Equilibrium Plots (`ternary_plots.py`)

- **Right-angle triangle diagram:** Both phase envelope curves, tie-lines, operating lines, stage construction.
- **N vs X, Y plot:** Solvent ratio curves for both phases.
- **X vs Y distribution diagram:** With 45° line for reference.
- Use Matplotlib for static plots; Plotly for interactive (embedded in GUI).

#### 3.2 Heatmaps (`heatmaps.py`)

For any solved extraction (cross or countercurrent), generate heatmaps using Seaborn/Plotly showing:

- **Composition heatmap:** Rows = components (A, C, B), Columns = stage number. Separate for raffinate and extract.
- **Flow rate heatmap:** R_i and E_i at each stage.
- **Percentage removal heatmap:** Cumulative and per-stage % removal of solute C.
- Color scales should be intuitive (e.g., diverging for composition, sequential for removal).

#### 3.3 Response Surface Plots (`surfaces.py`)

- **3D surface plots** (Plotly): % removal as a function of two inputs (e.g., n_stages vs solvent_amount).
- **Contour plots:** 2D projections of the response surface.
- **Optimal point marking:** Highlight the optimum on the surface.
- Support all pairwise combinations of 3 inputs: (n_stages, solvent_amount, feed_composition).

---

### Phase 4: Surrogate Model — Data Generation & Neural Network

**Goal:** Generate synthetic data via solver sweeps, train a PyTorch ANN, and use it for fast prediction and optimization.

#### 4.1 Synthetic Data Generation (`mass_transfer/ml/data_generator.py`)

Run the crosscurrent/countercurrent solver over a grid of input parameters:

| Input Parameter    | Range (example) | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `n_stages`         | 1–20            | Number of extraction stages                       |
| `solvent_amount`   | 100–5000 kg     | Solvent flow per stage (cross) or total (counter) |
| `feed_composition` | 5–45 wt% acid   | Initial oleic acid content in feed                |

**Output:** `% removal of solute` (and optionally per-stage removal sequence).

Store as a Pandas DataFrame / CSV for reproducibility. Target ~5000–10000 data points.

#### 4.2 Neural Network Model (`mass_transfer/ml/neural_net.py`)

**Architecture:**

- **ANN (feedforward):** Input(3) → Hidden(64, ReLU, BatchNorm) → Hidden(32, ReLU, BatchNorm) → Output(1)
  - Predicts overall % removal from (n_stages, solvent_amount, feed_composition).
- **Optional RNN (LSTM/GRU):** For predicting sequential stage-by-stage removal.
  - Input: process parameters → Output: sequence of % removal at each stage.

#### 5.7 Tab 6: Animation (`animation_tab.py`)

- **Generate animated GIF visualizations** of extraction processes.
- Four animation types:

| Animation | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Stage-by-Stage X-Y Stepping | Stages appear one-by-one on the distribution diagram |
| Ternary Diagram Build-up | Raffinate/extract points appear on the right-angle triangle per stage |
| Composition Profile Evolution | Grouped bar chart grows stage-by-stage + cumulative removal line |
| Parameter Sensitivity Sweep | Varies one parameter, solves for each, shows X-Y + ternary + rolling metrics |

- Built-in GIF player with Play/Pause controls at configurable FPS.
- Save GIF export button.
- Uses Matplotlib FuncAnimation + PillowWriter (no ffmpeg required).

### Phase 6: Integration, Testing & Validation

#### 6.1 Unit Tests (`tests/`)

- Test equilibrium fitting against known data points.
- Test crosscurrent solver against Problem Part (ii) hand-calculated values.
- Test countercurrent solver against Problem Part (iii) expected results.
- Test NN model convergence on a small dataset.

#### 6.2 Validation Workflow

Run the complete pipeline for the cottonseed oil system:

1. Load the bundled default dataset → fit equilibrium → verify plots match expected curves.
2. Solve Part (ii) crosscurrent → verify compositions and weights.
3. Solve Part (iii) countercurrent with reflux → verify min stages, min reflux, design at R=4.5.
4. Generate surrogate data → train NN → generate response surfaces.
5. Run GUI end-to-end.

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the GUI:** `python -m mass_transfer.gui` or `mass-transfer-gui`
2. The default cottonseed oil equilibrium data loads automatically
3. Go to **Simulation** tab → select mode → click **Run Simulation**
4. View results in **Heatmaps** tab
5. Train a surrogate model in **Surrogate Model** tab → set split ratios → click **Show Data Split Visuals**
6. Validate the NN: use **NN vs Solver Comparison** (Section 5 in Surrogate tab)
7. **Compare modes** side-by-side in the **⚖ Comparison** tab
8. Generate **animated GIF** visualizations in the **🎬 Animation** tab

## Implementation Order

```
Phase 0  →  Phase 1  →  Phase 2  →  Phase 3  →  Phase 4  →  Phase 5  →  Phase 6
 Equil.    Cross-curr.  Counter-curr.   Viz        ML/NN       GUI       Testing
 Model      Solver       Solver       Module     Surrogate   PyQt6     Validation
```

Each phase is self-contained and testable before moving to the next. Phases 3 and 4 can be partially parallelized since they depend on Phases 0–2 outputs but not on each other.
